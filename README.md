# UFOs
## Project Overview 
The purpose of this module and Challenge was to apply the HTML knowledge learned in module 10, along with new knowledge in programming with JavaScript, to create a web page that can actively "listen" to what the user is inputting to filter the data and display updated results for specific UFO sightings.
  

## Results
The data used for this webpage is stored in the JavaScript Array titled data.js. 

There are five different criteria that the table can be filtered by: date, city, state, country, and shape. By utilizing Bootstrap, these filters allow the user to dynamically update the webpage to automatically apply the filters to the data and display the updated table results. 

Shown below is the filters and start of the unfiltered data table.
